This Huffman Encoder can simply encode and decode any file extension
including: .txt, .mp3, .mp4, .png
be careful that file extensions that already have an built-in enconder will be bigger after compression!!

USAGE:

COMPRESSING
1.Open the .exe file located Huffman-Encoder-and-Decoder-main\apMaligninho\x64\Debug
2.Select "Comprimir Arquivo"
3.Type in the file folder WITHOUT the file, following the example
4.Type in the file name with the extension, for example: Bloxstrap.exe or SaveInsta.mp4
5.Wait for the file to be compressed, the compressed file will be put in the same folder with the .pcb extension

DECOMPRESSING
1.Open the .exe file located Huffman-Encoder-and-Decoder-main\apMaligninho\x64\Debug
2.Select "Descomprimir Arquivo"
3.Type in the file folder WITHOUT the file, following the example
4.Type in the file name without the extension, for example: Bloxstrap or SaveInsta
5.Wait for the file to be decompressed, the decompressed file will be put in the same folder with the name "decompressed_filename" and the original extension
